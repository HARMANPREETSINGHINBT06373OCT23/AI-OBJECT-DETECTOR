# AI-OBJECT-DETECTOR # 🚀 SmartVision AI - Real-Time Object Detection via Web

SmartVision AI is a web-based real-time object detection application that uses your device's webcam and the power of **YOLOv8** (You Only Look Once) to detect and identify objects live. Built using **Flask** and **Ultralytics YOLO**, it delivers fast and interactive AI camera capability directly in your browser.
